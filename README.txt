A very simlpe webScraper that is meant to scrape model name, price, style and sizes in stock of nike shoes from the sale part of a nike website and insert them into a csv file.
This was the first program that I have ever written and with some considerable improvements I can see it being useful.

Oh and this program can be broken by a simple update of their website, so you might have to change a thing or two.
Please be relatively mindfull of using this.
