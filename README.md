# NikeWebScraper

A very simple web scraper that is meant to scrape model names, prices, styles, and sizes in stock of Nike shoes from the sale part of a Nike website and insert them into a CSV file.
This was the first program that I have ever written and with some considerable improvements, I can see it being useful.

Oh, and this program can be broken by a simple update of their website, so you might have to change a thing or two.
Please be relatively mindfull of using this.
